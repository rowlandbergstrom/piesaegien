This is probably going to sound stupid because I've never done something like this before, I've got an old laptop that bricked its OS when it overheated, I was wondering if I could buy a new hard drive (have no way to access the old one) and then use a USB disk that I make on my chromebook to put actual Chrome OS onto that laptop?

I recently upgraded to FreeNAS 11.2 (from 9.10) by installing fresh on two new USB drives. I imported my old configuration file, then unlocked my storage using my previously stored geli.key file. However, when I reboot, my drives are once again locked and I need to manually unlock them again. I'm only interested in protecting my data "at rest" (for example, I want to be able to send a drive in for warranty work without worrying about the data). There is no `/data/geli` directory.
